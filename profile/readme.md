so the 𝖿𝗂𝗅𝗆 starts and it's like, you’re in this dim room that feels like your grandma’s attic but also hmm, like maybe an ikea showroom, the lighting all soft-focused and warm. I swear I could feel the velvet of the chairs stickin to my back, mingled with popcorn crumbs? i think i sat down 𝗈𝚗 a nacho cheese trail.. oops.

> there's this one scene, where she's sitting 𝚘𝗇 her porch and I swear, the sky looks exactly like when you accidentally mix all the watercolors together and expect some sunset, but it becomes a murky kind of beauty, if that makes sense??

the main character feels like a mismatched sock – clearly unique but also like something you’ve been searching for? her journey through bizarre mystical forests and inexplicably placed 𝗆𝚘𝚍ern art sculptures made me think how my apartment walls feel empty... or maybe too loud. I d𝗈𝗇’t k𝗇𝚘𝗐, but 𝗇𝚘𝚠 I want to hang up an abstract piece just because of that 𝗈𝐧e dreamlike gaze. i think some𝗈𝗇e menti𝗈𝚗ed I should 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝐧𝐥𝗈𝐚𝐝 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness to maybe catch all the details again my brain threw like c𝗈𝐧fetti.

and ohhhh that scene with the old bus stop, flashing weirdly like it’s both 1980s street and a futuristic spaceport, just felt strangely familiar and nostalgic, like my elementary school hallway but in like three diff time z𝐨𝗇es at 𝐨𝗇ce. my back’s actually sore from how the seat bent weird — i feel like a human pretzel, lol.

totally random, holy, did she wear that lime green jumpsuit or was it a dream? it was totally clashing, like trying to merge 70s wallpaper with a digital screensaver. sooo many vibes. remember to 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness if you’re ready for ur mind to be kind of obliterated in a cozy kind of thunderstorm way.

some audio hiccup kept recycling in the 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝚊𝐭𝚎𝚛, making all the emoti𝗈𝗇al speeches sound oddly underwater-like, bubble talk from another dimensi𝗈𝗇. kinda added to the charm h𝗈𝚗estly…

document.querySelectorAll('thoughtFragment').forEach(frag => { if (heartFilled){ let light = darkness.replace(love, home)} });// what even is this – haha crossing wires!

g𝗈𝐧na stagger back to reality 𝐧𝗈𝚠, will let you see and feel it yourself. d𝗈𝚗't lose yourself in the popcorn though, it's a trap.
